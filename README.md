# Welcome!
This is my personal website, hosted at [davidliao.ca](davidliao.ca).

It includes some basic information about myself and some of my projects.

It was previously a Spring/Thymeleaf web application, but in an effort to reduce costs associated with running a server, I've converted it into a static React app. (So, most of the stuff is still in HTML rather than React components!)
